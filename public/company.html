			<h2>We are the Busy Bees</h2>
			<p><strong>We work in the spaces between science, technology, business and wonder.</strong></p>
			<p>
				<strong>Startups and individuals come to us to get our unique perspective on people, products, technologies, and to discover new opportunities.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Over the past few years we have worked with Samsung, Nokia, Burton, the BBC and many other amazing companies.</p>
			<p>
				Busy Bees was founded by Jack McMillan, Alana Frigato and Mick Scott in 2007, that’s us on the left. Scroll on to read a little more about the things we’ve done.

			<h2>First there was Alana</h2>
			<p><strong>Alana Frigato </strong>is in charge of <strong>design and research</strong> at Busy Bees.</p>
			<p>
				She trained as an Industrial Designer at the Institute of Technology in Turin, ran her own fashion label for 3 years in Berlin before coming to London where she studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College and Industrial Design Engineering at the Royal College of Art.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alana was born in a small village lost in the mountains of Italy. She grew up between her mother’s fashion shop and her father’s mechanical factory, playing with textiles, sequins, metals and mechanisms from an early age. She is fascinated by industrial production and manufacturing processes, along with materials and fashion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before founding Busy Bees, Alana worked at the BBC Innovation Unit, and spent 2 years investigating the relationship between technology and people, as a Research Associate at the RCA’s Helen Hamlyn Centre, winning many awards for her pioneering user centered design process, amongst them the Futurelab Innovate to Educate Award, the Helen Hamlyn Award for Creativity, the Future Foundation Award for Inclusive Design Process, an IDEA Award and the Help the Aged Award for Independent Living.

			<h2>Then she met Jack</h2>
			<p><strong>Jack McMillan</strong> heads up <strong>invention and ergonomics</strong> at Busy Bees.</p>
			<p>
				He trained as a Mechanical Engineer and Designer at the University of Bath, Royal College of Art and Imperial College, London, and often draws from his past work in the department of Cognitive Ergonomics at Renault automotive.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jack is happiest in one of two places; in the workshop making an idea into a reality or in an auditorium speaking about the psychology behind people using products and technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				As such his work often combines a unique combination physical and mechanical design alongside an in depth understanding of the human interactions involved. Jack was the James Dyson Innovation Fellow in 2010 and his work has seen him as a finalist in the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi World Changing Ideas Award as well as being selected as one of Wallpaper* magazines 10 Designs for 2010. Jack is the creator of the foldable wheelchair wheel, a patented and licensed design, and is often described by Alana as the “structural poet” of Busy Bees!

			<h2>Finally Mick joined in</h2>
			<p><strong>Mick Scott </strong>is in charge of<strong> technology and magic</strong> at Busy Bees.</p>
			<p>
				Mick has a Masters in Electronic Engineering from Bristol University along with an MA in Industrial Design, from the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London. He teaches at Queen Mary University of London and Goldsmiths, and is also a Member of the Magic Circle.
			</p>
			<p>
				His work combines his background in electronics and magic (Mick has trained as a professional magician) in the field of design. In 2007 he patented the Magic Light, a system to magically move spotlight beams using nothing but hand gestures.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project has taken him to consulting with many of the major lighting brands worldwide, as well as gaining him the James Dyson Innovation Fellowship in 2007, Residency at the Design Museum in 2009 and the Royal Commission of 1851 Fellowship in 2010.
			</p>
			<p>
				Previously he worked as a consultant inventor for a US television series in Peru, Mexico and California. He has worked with artists collective Greyworld and consulted for the BBC as well for consumer electronics brands including Samsung and Nokia, work which has taken him everywhere from Seoul to Vermont to Vienna – always with a pack of cards in his back pocket.

			<h2>And they got started</h2>
			<p><strong>Busy Bees </strong>was founded in <strong> 2009</strong> as they figured out how incredible they are together.</p>
			<p>
				Since the start, they have been involved in faboulous projects like creating indoor clouds or building a radio which can broadcast to the future. Not only they are happy to assist charity projects like the Hope Soap, they are proud supporters of staff-baed product development.
