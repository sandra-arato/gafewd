	<h3>Who will I have to contact for pay slips?</h3>
	<p>That would be Diana, our finance guru. Make sure to give you bank details to her on your first or second day.</p>
	<h3>When do I get paid?</h3>
	<p>All of our staff gets their monthly salary on the 1st business day of the month.</p>
	<h3>Do you guys usually order in for lunch or go out and pick something up?</h3>
	<p>That really depends on several factors. On nice sunny days, we like to have our lunch in Hyde Park. Other times we cook a quick pasta together for all of the team. And if none of the above, we just bring our own food to the office.</p>
	<h3>How long is the lunch break?</h3>
	<p>Nobody will check how much time you take for lunch. If you do decide to take a lunchbreak longer than 40-50 minutes though, please let someone know that you'll be away for a longer time.</p>
