		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<p>Answers to your qestions that you might not want to ask on a first day.</p>
		<span id="faq-answer-display">hide all</span>
		<h3>Who will I have to contact for pay slips?</h3>
		<p>That would be Diana, our finance guru. Make sure to give you bank details to her on your first or second day.</p>
		<h3>When do I get paid?</h3>
		<p>All of our staff gets their monthly salary on the 1st business day of the month.</p>
		<h3>Do you order in for lunch or go out and pick something up?</h3>
		<p>That really depends on several factors. On nice sunny days, we like to have our lunch in Hyde Park. Other times we cook a quick pasta together for all of the team. And if none of the above, we just bring our own food to the office.</p>
		<h3>How long is the lunch break?</h3>
		<p>Nobody will check how much time you take for lunch. If you do decide to take a lunchbreak longer than 40-50 minutes though, please let someone know that you'll be away for a longer time.</p>
		<h3>Is smoking allowed?</h3>
		<p>We're a non-smoking workplace and don't smoke in the office. If you like you can have a cigarette outside the building just make sure to use the ashtray next to the bins at the garage door.</p>
		<h3>Is there a policy for practising my religion at the workplace?</h3>
		<p class="last">We're as open about this as you are. If you have specific needs due to your religion, let us know and we'll work something out. Same thing with meal preferences and community events.</p>
